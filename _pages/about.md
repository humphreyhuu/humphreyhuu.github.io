My name is Pengfei Hu. I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at [Stevens Institute of Technology]([https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science)), co-advised by Prof. [Yue Ning](https://yue-ning.github.io) and Prof. [Ping Wang](https://leafnlp.org/ping). Before that, I obtained my master's degree from the Viterbi School of Engineering, [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu) in 2023, where I worked with Prof. [Sze-chuan Suen](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Suen/Sze-chuan).

My current research concentrates on predictive healthcare on electronic health records (EHR), with a specific focus on augmented (e.g. [knowledge-guided](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19955) and [retrieval augmented](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16288)) language models and their robustness under domain shifts. I have also worked on graph neural networks and [llm agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16288).

Feel free to drop me an email (`phu9 at stevens dot edu`) if you have any questions about my research, or want to discuss about potential collaborations.

**<span style="color:red">I am looking for internship/fulltime industrial opportunities, starting from Spring 2025. Feel free to reach out if there is a good fit!</span>**
